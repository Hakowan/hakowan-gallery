# Mesh deformation

This example aims to visualize the deformed surface that are k-harmonic with k=1,2,3 and 4.
This example is inspired by figure 2 from the paper "[An Intuitive Framework for Real-Time Freeform Modeling](https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/modeling1.pdf)".

## Data

The input [cylinder](https://github.com/qnzhou/hakowan-gallery/blob/main/gallery/Deformation/data/cylinder.ply) is generate with Blender, and its deformed shapes are generated using the script
[deform.py](https://github.com/qnzhou/hakowan-gallery/blob/main/gallery/Deformation/deform.py).
