This example aims to reproduce [Figure 22](https://ipc-sim.github.io/file/IPC-squishyBall.jpg) from
the paper "[Incremental Potential Contact: Intersection- and Inversion-free Large Deformation
Dynamics](https://ipc-sim.github.io/)".

## Data

The data were generated by compiling and running the [original IPC code](https://github.com/ipc-sim/IPC):

```sh
./IPC_bin -o out 100 ../input/paperExamples/22_squishyBall.txt out
```
We used the output file [7.obj](https://github.com/qnzhou/hakowan-gallery/blob/main/gallery/IPC/data/7.obj) as an example for this figure. The [plate.obj
](https://github.com/qnzhou/hakowan-gallery/blob/main/gallery/IPC/data/plate.obj) file is generated by hand for visualization purposes.
